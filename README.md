# Rebooting the Web-of-Trust

This repository contains documents related to the "Rebooting the Web-of-Trust" series of events in the fall of 2016.

## DesignShop October 19th - 21st, 2016

The third DesignShop event, to be held in the San Francisco Bay Area on October 19th, 20th, & the 21st 2016, is a facilitated, invite-only event focused on creating the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. The goal of this initial DesignShop is to generate 5 technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that will have the greatest impact on the future.

### Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the October DesignShop, all participants were requested to post in the [Topics and Advanced Readings](topics-and-advance-readings) folder a 1 or 2 page topics paper to be shared with other attendees on either:
* A specific problem that you'd like to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (pgp or ca-based pki) can't address the problem?
*  A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?
